# Purpose

This repository contains word count programs which creates bag-of-words in various programming languages to support (not completely as of now, but in future):
 
* Various conditions to bag-of-words such as the minimum number of each word in a document, etc.
* Documents in English and in Japanese
* Parsing in concurrent way employing threads
* Web interface to check the intermediate report including throughput
* Test program to check if the program produces correct results with or without threads (in share directory)

Hoping to provide as a module in these programming languages. In terms of it, this repository is like an ecosystem to try and learn implementations in a better way.
